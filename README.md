# Learning Styles Classification Model


We will be working on: 
- Problem
- Objectives and Goals
- Model ( CatBoost )
- Methodology
- Prototype



***

### Problem
The primary problem addressed is the classification of students' learning styles based on their questionnaire responses.  
Educators often struggle to tailor their teaching methods to meet diverse learning preferences, which can lead to disengagement and suboptimal learning outcomes.



***

### Objectives and Goals
Develop a predictive catboost model that accurately classifies students' learning styles based on their responses to the VAK questionnaire.



***

### What is CatBoost?
- CatBoost, short for "Categorical Boosting”, is an algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees. developed by Yandex, it’s is an advanced gradient boosting algorithm designed to handle categorical data efficiently.
- Open-source.
- Ease of Use: Minimal preprocessing required for categorical data.
- High Performance: Efficient feature interactions.
- Robustness: Built-in mechanisms to reduce overfitting and enhance generalization.
- Ability to generate high-performance models with minimal data preprocessing.
- Its efficiency in managing imbalanced datasets makes it particularly suitable for this classification task, where learning styles is not evenly distributed.
